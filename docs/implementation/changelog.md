## [2.1.5] - 2025-05-28

### Refactor
- **Centralized Core Models**: Moved `MealHistoryEntry`, `FoodItem`, `NutritionalSummary`, `MealSource`, and `MealType` from `lib/features/advanced_meal_mgmt/domain/entities/meal_history.dart` to a new central location at `lib/core/models/meal_models.dart`.
- **Updated Imports**: Modified all relevant files across the `advanced_meal_mgmt` feature and `dashboard_screen.dart` to use the new import path for these core models.
- **Code Generation**: Ran `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` to update Freezed generated files for the moved models.
- **Lint Fixes**: Resolved lint errors in `meal_history_screen.dart` related to `MealHistoryFilter` import and an unnecessary cast.
- **Enum Consolidation**: Ensured `GoalType` enum remains in `lib/features/advanced_meal_mgmt/domain/entities/meal_history.dart` and removed an accidental duplicate from `lib/core/models/meal_models.dart`.

### Chore
- Deleted the old `lib/meal_history_screen.dart` and its associated `LoggedMeal` model as part of model consolidation.
