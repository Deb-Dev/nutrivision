NutriVision: Phased User Stories
This document outlines the detailed user stories for the development of NutriVision, broken down into phases and epics, based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD).

Phase 1: MVP - Core Onboarding, Tracking & Basic Planning
Epic 1: User Onboarding & Profile Management
User Story 1.1: Sign up with Email
As a new user,
I want to be able to sign up for NutriVision using my email address and a password,
So that I can create a secure account to store my nutritional data.

Product Requirements:

Input fields for email and password (with confirmation).

Password strength indicator and validation (e.g., min length, complexity).

Link to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, requiring acceptance.

Clear error messaging for invalid email format, weak password, or email already in use.

Successful signup should lead to the profile setup process.

Consider email verification step.

Technical Requirements:

Front-end: Email/password input forms, client-side validation (React Native/Flutter).

Back-end: API endpoint for user registration (e.g., using Firebase Authentication or custom logic on AWS). Secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt).

Database (e.g., Firestore, MongoDB): Users collection with fields for userId, email, hashedPassword, isVerified, createdAt, updatedAt.

Email Service: Integration for sending verification emails (e.g., Firebase, AWS SES).

Acceptance Criteria:

User can successfully create an account with a valid email and strong password.

User receives a verification email (if implemented).

Passwords are not stored in plain text.

Appropriate error messages are shown for invalid inputs or existing accounts.

User is directed to the next step in onboarding (profile setup).

User Story 1.2: Sign in with Email
As an existing user,
I want to be able to sign in to NutriVision using my email and password,
So that I can access my account and nutritional data.

Product Requirements:

Input fields for email and password.

"Forgot Password" functionality link.

Clear error messaging for incorrect credentials, unverified email, or locked account.

Successful sign-in should lead to the user dashboard.

Technical Requirements:

Front-end: Email/password input forms.

Back-end: API endpoint for user login. Compare provided password with stored hash. Session management (e.g., JWT tokens, Firebase session handling).

Database: Verify credentials against the Users collection.

Acceptance Criteria:

User can successfully sign in with correct credentials for a verified account.

User is redirected to the dashboard upon successful login.

"Forgot Password" link is present (functionality in a separate story).

Appropriate error messages are shown for incorrect credentials or other login issues.

User Story 1.5: Initial Profile Data Capture
As a new user,
After signing up,
I want to provide my basic information: age, weight (with units kg/lbs), height (with units cm/ft-in), biological sex (for BMR calculation), activity level, and primary dietary goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance),
So that NutriVision can calculate baseline nutritional needs (e.g., BMR, TDEE) and begin to personalize my experience.

Product Requirements:

User-friendly, intuitive multi-step form or single-page interface.

Clear labels, input types (e.g., number pickers, sliders, dropdowns/radio buttons).

Units selection for weight (kg/lbs) and height (cm/ft-inches).

Activity levels clearly defined (e.g., Sedentary, Lightly Active, Moderately Active, Very Active).

Dietary goals selection (e.g., Lose Weight, Maintain Weight, Gain Muscle).

Data validation for sensible inputs (e.g., realistic age, weight, height ranges).

Option to skip/come back later for non-critical fields if applicable.

Technical Requirements:

Front-end: Forms for data input, unit conversion logic if displaying in multiple units.

Back-end: API endpoint to save profile data. Logic to calculate BMR (e.g., Mifflin-St Jeor equation) and TDEE based on activity level. Store calculated targets.

Database: User profile collection/document with fields for age, weight (value, unit), height (value, unit), sex, activityLevel, dietaryGoals, calculatedBMR, calculatedTDEE, calorieTarget, proteinTarget, carbTarget, fatTarget.

Acceptance Criteria:

User can input all required profile data with their preferred units.

Data is validated and saved correctly to their profile.

Baseline nutritional targets (calories, basic macros) are calculated and stored.

User is informed of their initial targets.

User Story 1.6: Dietary Preferences & Restrictions Setup
As a new user,
During profile setup,
I want to specify my dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, paleo, keto) and any allergies or restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, dairy-free, common allergens like nuts, soy, shellfish),
So that meal recommendations, AI analysis, and tracking are accurately tailored to my needs and safety.

Product Requirements:

Multi-select options for common dietary preferences.

Multi-select for common allergies (e.g., peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish).

Option for free-text input for less common allergies/restrictions (with a note that AI will try its best).

Clear indication of how this information will be used, especially regarding allergy safety.

Ability to update these preferences later in settings.

Technical Requirements:

Front-end: UI for selecting preferences and inputting allergies (e.g., searchable multi-select lists).

Back-end: API endpoint to save dietary preferences and restrictions.

Database: Store preferences (e.g., array of strings like ["vegan", "gluten-free"]) and allergies (e.g., array of strings ["peanuts", "shellfish"]) in the user profile. Consider a structured way to store common allergens for easier filtering.

Acceptance Criteria:

User can select/input their dietary preferences and restrictions.

This information is saved correctly to their profile.

The system can later use this data critically for filtering and recommendations, especially for allergies.

User Story 1.7: View User Dashboard (MVP)
As a logged-in user,
I want to see a simple dashboard summarizing my current day's nutritional progress against my targets,
So that I can quickly understand how I'm tracking.

Product Requirements (MVP):

Display today's consumed calories vs. target calories (e.g., progress bar or "X out of Y kcal").

Display today's consumed macronutrients (protein, carbs, fat) vs. targets.

Clear visual indication of remaining calories/macros.

Easy navigation/button to log a new meal.

Date display, ability to view previous day's summary (simple navigation).

Technical Requirements:

Front-end: UI to display summary data. Fetch data from the backend upon loading and after new meal logs.

Back-end: API endpoint to retrieve daily summary (calories, macros consumed so far for the current day, and targets from user profile). This will involve aggregating data from today's LoggedMeals.

Database: Efficiently query LoggedMeals for the current user and date. User profile stores targets.

Acceptance Criteria:

Dashboard displays accurate calorie and macronutrient information for the current day.

Targets are clearly shown and sourced from the user's profile.

Navigation to meal logging is prominent and functional.

Dashboard updates in near real-time after a meal is logged.
