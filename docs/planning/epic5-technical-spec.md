- **Purpose**: Leverage user data and preferences to suggest meals and recipes
- **Key Components**:
  - Suggestion algorithm based on historical meal preferences
  - Integration with nutrition goals and dietary restrictions
  - Machine learning model to improve suggestions over time
  - User feedback system to refine suggestions

### 1.2 Custom Meal Planning
- **Purpose**: Allow users to plan meals in advance for days or weeks
- **Key Components**:
  - Calendar-based meal scheduling interface
  - Drag and drop meal assignment
  - Bulk meal planning capabilities
  - Template-based weekly plans

### 1.3 Grocery List Generation
- **Purpose**: Create shopping lists based on planned meals
- **Key Components**:
  - Ingredient extraction and consolidation
  - Quantity calculation based on servings
  - List export functionality (PDF, sharing, etc.)
  - Categorization of ingredients for shopping efficiency

### 1.4 Diet Plan Integration
- **Purpose**: Connect meal planning to specific diet plans and goals
- **Key Components**:
  - Predefined diet plan templates
  - Goal-based meal allocation
  - Progress tracking against plan
  - Adaptation based on actual consumption

## 6. Technical Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| AI suggestion accuracy | High | Medium | Implement fallback options and user feedback loop |
| Performance with large meal plans | Medium | High | Implement pagination and lazy loading |
| Data synchronization complexity | High | Medium | Robust conflict resolution strategy |
| Offline functionality limitations | Medium | Low | Clear user expectations and graceful degradation |

## 7. Open Questions
- What is the optimal approach for recipe data storage?
- How should we handle ingredient variations and substitutions?
- What level of customization should be allowed in meal plans?
- How do we handle seasonal ingredient availability?
