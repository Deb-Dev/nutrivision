## Smart Meal Planning Fixes Applied

### Issues Fixed:

#### 1. **Firebase Index Error**
**Problem:** The query in `_buildRejectionContext` required a composite index that wasn't set up.
**Solution:** Temporarily bypassed the Firebase query to avoid index requirements. Added comprehensive logging and TODO for proper index setup.

#### 2. **Type Error: String/Int Index Issue**
**Problem:** `type 'String' is not a subtype of type 'int' of 'index'` error in ingredient parsing.
**Solutions Applied:**
- Added explicit type conversion with `.toString()` for all ingredient fields
- Added comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Added detailed logging to identify exact error location
- Added proper generic type specification for `.map<SuggestedFoodItem>()`

#### 3. **Widget Unmounted Error**
**Problem:** Context accessed after widget disposal in `_showAcceptedMessage`.
**Solution:** Added `mounted` checks before accessing context.

### Code Changes:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Added try-catch blocks with stack traces
   - Added detailed logging for debugging
   - Added null-safe field access

2. **Firebase Query Bypass:**
   - Temporarily disabled complex Firebase queries
   - Added TODO comments for future index setup
   - Maintained API compatibility

3. **Type Safety Improvements:**
   - Added explicit type conversions
   - Added null safety checks
   - Added generic type specifications

### Testing Recommendation:
The app should now work without the previous errors. The suggestion generation will use fallback logic until Firebase indexes are properly configured.

### Next Steps:
1. Set up Firebase composite indexes for production
2. Re-enable full rejection context queries
3. Monitor logs for any remaining type errors
